# Football Mixer

A project made at InHolland University of Applied Sciences for the Big Data & AI minor.

The 'app' folder contains a Python project that uses the Flask framework to create a REST API, which interacts with a ML model that analyses microphone data input to determine the sounds of a football match.

The 'client' folder contains a Quasar project that uses Vue.js to interact with the REST API.

## Requirements for Client

- Node.js
- Yarn

## Getting Client to work

Go to the 'client' folder and run the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
yarn run dev
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
yarn run build
```
