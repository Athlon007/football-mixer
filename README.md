# Football Mixer

A project made at InHolland University of Applied Sciences for the Big Data & AI minor.

The 'app' folder contains a Python project that uses the Flask framework to create a REST API, which interacts with a ML model that analyses microphone data input to determine the sounds of a football match.

The 'client' folder contains a Quasar project that uses Vue.js to interact with the REST API.
